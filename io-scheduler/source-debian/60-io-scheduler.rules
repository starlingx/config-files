# This file contains the rules to customize io scheduler.

# Need nodetype environment variable
IMPORT{file}="/etc/platform/platform.conf"

# 3.10 kernel
# Heuristics:
# 'deadline' io-scheduler tuned settings
# - deadline generally recommended for databases, servers, and SSDs,
#   and for more deterministic latency
# - note that read_expire is a key tuning parameter here
# - the following is recommended by DRBD user guide
#     front_merges:    0 (from 1)
#     read_expire:   150 (from 500)
#     write_expire: 1500 (from 5000)
#
# 'cfq' io scheduler tuned settings
# - recommended for HDD, and fairness (ionice)
# - the following tuned values greatly improve parallelism,
#   and performance in large storage environments
#     slice_idle: 0 (from 8)
#     quantum:   32 (from 8)
#
# 'noop' io scheduler for variants of HW-RAID.
# - RAID controller will do its own separate scheduling
#
# Overall:
# - Historically we choose 'deadline' for low-latency, SSDs, and local storage;
#   'cfq' for worker non-sda HDDs, 'noop' for all variants of HW-RAID.
# - We prefer to guarantee latency more than fairness for all platform services,
#   especially under extreme read and write load, e.g, when creating/deleting
#   multiple heat stacks, or running disk intensive operations.
# - Kubernetes etcd server has better latency with cfq as compared
#   to deadline even on SSDs.
# - This setting requires re-evaluation with io-schedulers
#   (i.e., mq-deadline, bfq, kyber) available in new kernels.

# 5.10 kernel
# Heuristics:
# 'none'
# - Implements a first-in first-out (FIFO) scheduling algorithm. It
#   merges requests at the generic block layer through a simple last-hit cache.
# 'mq-deadline'
# - Attempts to provide a guaranteed latency for requests from the point at
#   which requests reach the scheduler.
# - This scheduler is suitable for most use cases, but particularly those in
#   which the write operations are mostly asynchronous.
# 'bfq'
# - Targets desktop systems and interactive tasks.
# - The bfq scheduler ensures that a single application is never using all of
#   the bandwidth. In effect, the storage device is always as responsive as if
#   it was idle. In its default configuration, bfq focuses on delivering the
#   lowest latency rather than achieving the maximum throughput.
# - bfq is based on cfq code. It does not grant the disk to each process for
#   a fixed time slice but assigns a budget measured in number of sectors to the process.
# - This scheduler is suitable while copying large files and the system does not become
#   unresponsive in this case.
# 'kyber'
# - The scheduler tunes itself to achieve a latency goal by calculating the latencies
#   of every I/O request submitted to the block I/O layer. You can configure the target
#   latencies for read, in the case of cache-misses, and synchronous write requests.
# - This scheduler is suitable for fast devices, for example NVMe, SSD, or other low
#   latency devices.
#
# Overall:
# - Traditional HDD with a SCSI interface: Use mq-deadline or bfq
# - High-performance SSD or a CPU-bound system with fast storage: Use none,
#   especially when running enterprise applications. Alternatively, use kyber.
# - Desktop or interactive tasks: Use bfq.
# - Virtual guest: Use mq-deadline. With a host bus adapter (HBA) driver that
#   is multi-queue capable, use none.
