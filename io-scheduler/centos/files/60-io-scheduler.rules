# This file contains the rules to customize io scheduler.

# Need nodetype environment variable
IMPORT{file}="/etc/platform/platform.conf"

# Heuristics:
# 'deadline' io-scheduler tuned settings
# - deadline generally recommended for databases, servers, and SSDs,
#   and for more deterministic latency
# - note that read_expire is a key tuning parameter here
# - the following is recommended by DRBD user guide
#     front_merges:    0 (from 1)
#     read_expire:   150 (from 500)
#     write_expire: 1500 (from 5000)
#
# 'cfq' io scheduler tuned settings
# - recommended for HDD, and fairness (ionice)
# - the following tuned values greatly improve parallelism,
#   and performance in large storage environments
#     slice_idle: 0 (from 8)
#     quantum:   32 (from 8)
#
# 'noop' io scheduler for variants of HW-RAID.
# - RAID controller will do its own separate scheduling
#
# Overall:
# - Historically we choose 'deadline' for low-latency, SSDs, and local storage;
#   'cfq' for worker non-sda HDDs, 'noop' for all variants of HW-RAID.
# - We prefer to guarantee latency more than fairness for all platform services,
#   especially under extreme read and write load, e.g, when creating/deleting
#   multiple heat stacks, or running disk intensive operations.
# - Kubernetes etcd server has better latency with cfq as compared
#   to deadline even on SSDs.
# - This setting requires re-evaluation with io-schedulers
#   (i.e., mq-deadline, bfq, kyber) available in new kernels.
